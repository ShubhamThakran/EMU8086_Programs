# EMU8086_Programs
Computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU) built on a single Integrated Circuit (IC) is called a microprocessor.

A digital computer with one microprocessor which acts as a CPU is called microcomputer.
It is a programmable, multipurpose, clock -driven, register-based electronic device that reads binary instructions from a storage device called memory, 
accepts binary data as input and processes data according to those instructions and provides results as output.
A microprocessor consists of an ALU, control unit and register array. Where ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on the data received from an
input device or memory. Control unit controls the instructions and flow of data within the computer. And, register array consists of registers identified
by letters like B, C, D, E, H, L, and accumulator.
EMU8086 - MICROPROCESSOR EMULATOR is a free emulator for multiple platforms. It provides its user with the ability to emulate old 8086 processors, which 
were used in Macintosh and Windows computers from the 1980s and early 1990s.
What is the use of EMU 8086?
Emu8086 combines an advanced source editor, assembler, disassembler, software emulator (Virtual PC) with debugger, and step by step tutorials. This program
is extremely helpful for those who just begin to study assembly language. It compiles the source code and executes it on emulator step by step.
